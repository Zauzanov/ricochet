## 1. Download a wordlist for finding resources on a web-app: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content/File-Extensions-Universal-SVNDigger-Project
## 2. You can use this site to test the code: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/, as it is a part of Acunetix’s intentionally vulnerable demo targets (“vulnweb”) that are publicly provided for security testing and scanner demos. So this specific site is OK to scan for testing.
